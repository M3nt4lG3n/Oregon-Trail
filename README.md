# Oregon-Trail
 
This is the Fort Laramie group's Oregon Trail project based off of the diarist Elizabeth Myrick's experiences. We were tasked with creating an Oregon Trail game based off of the experiences of the diarist we chose at the start of the project. This is the final project which has been worked on over multiple weeks by Brian Bizon, Anthony Bellino, and Mason Greenawalt.
