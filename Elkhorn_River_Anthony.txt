Elizbeth thought to herself, we are now one the banks of Elkhorn River waiting for to be ferried across. This is the first river we have to cross on our jouney. It costs 2 dollars for each wagon across and the cattle would swim across the river. On the bank I saw a few graves where the Indians buried their dead.
