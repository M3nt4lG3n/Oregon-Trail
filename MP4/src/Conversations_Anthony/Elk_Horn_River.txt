Elizabeth thought to herself:

We are now one the banks of the 
Elk Horn River waiting to be ferried 
across. This is the first river we 
have to cross on our journey. It costs
2 dollars for each wagon across and 
the cattle would swim across the river. 
On the bank I saw a few graves where 
the Indians buried their dead.
