Elizabeth thought to herself: 

It is nice that after traveling for 
so long we finally are at a clean water 
source. To cross the Missouri River we needed 
to unload and the men are fixing the wagon beds 
for ferry boats to carry the provisions across 
the main channel. This process took more than 
one day, but by the next day we were able to cross.
