Elizabeth thought to herself:

We finally arrived at Fort Laramie. 
After arriving, I noticed how there 
were many people trading furs and other 
supplies here. We decided to stock up more 
supplies for the remainder of our journey. 
There was talk about which Indians tribes 
were friendly as well as others to watch out for.
