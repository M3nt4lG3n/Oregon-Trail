Elizabeth thought to herself, it is nice that arfter traveling or so long we fianlly are at a clean water source. To corss the Missouri River we needed to unload and the men are fixing the wagon beds for ferrry boats to carry the provisions aacross the main channel. This process took more than one day, but by the next day we were able to cross.
